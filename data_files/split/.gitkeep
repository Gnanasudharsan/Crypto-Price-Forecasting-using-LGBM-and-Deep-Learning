# This file ensures the empty directory is included in Git
# Split datasets (train/validation/test) will be placed in this directory

# Expected data format:
# - Subdirectories for each cryptocurrency (e.g., bitcoin/, ethereum/)
# - Each subdirectory contains numpy arrays:
#   * X_train.npy, y_train.npy: Training data
#   * X_val.npy, y_val.npy: Validation data
#   * X_test.npy, y_test.npy: Test data
#   * metadata.csv: Information about the split (feature names, split ratios)

# Data splitting script: data_splitting.py
# To generate files in this directory, run:
# python src/data/data_splitting.py --input-dir data/features --output-dir data/split
